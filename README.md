**AP Classroom Scripts**

For the [Answers Hider](https://github.com/patrickzhou1234/AP-Classroom-Scripts/blob/main/Answers-Hider.js), go to the completed tab of ap classroom and click on an assignment to review it. Click on the first question. Then, press '`' (tilde) to hide answers and press 'Shift' to toggle hide/show answer explanations. To select your answer, simply click on the answer choices like you usually would. This helps students study for exams by reviewing assignments they have done before.
