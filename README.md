**AP Classroom Scripts**

For the [Answers Hider](https://github.com/patrickzhou1234/AP-Classroom-Scripts/blob/main/Answers-Hider.js), go to the completed tab of ap classroom and click on an assignment to review it. Click on the first question. Then, press '`' (tilde) to hide answers and press 'Shift' to toggle hide/show answer explanations. To select your answer, simply click on the answer choices like you usually would. This helps students study for exams by reviewing assignments they have done before. 
***
<br>Clarification: The video [auto watcher](https://github.com/patrickzhou1234/APClassroomPlus/blob/main/AP20auto-watch.js) is NOT made by me, it is another developer's code. 
***
For the assignment [MCQ Autocompleter](https://github.com/patrickzhou1234/APClassroomPlus/blob/main/Autocompleter.js) before you click the assignment, go to network in developers console and then find the <code>activity?</code> request and then look at the response tab and copy the content. Then, click through and view all the mcqs in the assignment (you can skip 2 mcqs in between each time). Then, press '\' (backslash) and paste in what you copied from the response tab and press enter.
***
If you want to use both MCQ Autocompleter and Answers Hider concurrently, use the [Combined](https://github.com/patrickzhou1234/APClassroomPlus/blob/main/Combined.js) script instead.
